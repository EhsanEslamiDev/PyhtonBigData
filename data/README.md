# Sample Data Directory

This directory contains sample datasets for practicing big data processing with Python.

## Available Datasets

### 1. sales_data.csv
E-commerce sales transaction data containing:
- Transaction ID
- Product name and category
- Customer information
- Sales amount and quantity
- Timestamp

### 2. user_logs.txt
Web application log files with:
- IP addresses
- Request paths
- Response codes
- Timestamps
- User agents

### 3. stock_prices.json
Financial market data including:
- Stock symbols
- Daily prices (open, high, low, close)
- Trading volumes
- Market dates

### 4. customer_data.parquet
Customer information dataset with:
- Customer demographics
- Purchase history
- Behavioral data
- Segmentation features

## Data Generation Scripts

Use the following scripts to generate sample data:
- `generate_sales_data.py` - Creates realistic sales transactions
- `generate_logs.py` - Generates web server logs
- `generate_stock_data.py` - Creates financial market data
- `generate_customer_data.py` - Generates customer profiles

## Usage Notes

1. **File Sizes**: Sample datasets are kept small for development. For production testing, increase the size parameters in generation scripts.

2. **Formats**: Data is provided in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet) to practice with different file types.

3. **Privacy**: All data is synthetically generated and contains no real customer information.

4. **Performance**: Larger datasets can be generated by modifying the size parameters in the generation scripts.

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load sales data
sales_df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Load customer data (Parquet format)
customer_df = pd.read_parquet('customer_data.parquet')

# Load stock data (JSON format)
import json
with open('stock_prices.json', 'r') as f:
    stock_data = json.load(f)
```
